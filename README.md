This week we will practice geocoding, spatial joins and nearest neighbour analysis in Python. 

In this exercise the goal is to **find out how many people live within 1.5 km (Euclidean) distance from big shopping centers in the Helsinki Region** (Problems 1-3). In addition, you will figure out the closes shopping center from your home and work locations (Problem 4). 


- **Exercise 3 is due by Thursday the 19th of November at 5 pm** (one day before the next practical session).
